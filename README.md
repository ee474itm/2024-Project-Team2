# Beyond-the-Page: AI-Powered Multimedia Book for Children

By integrating user inputs with advanced AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs), image generation models, and text-tospeech (TTS) systems, our project produces engaging multimedia books that combine text, images, and audio.

## Run the code

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start` and `node server.js` 

You should replace `OPEN_API_KEY` and `TTS_API_KEY` with your own API Key before running the app.
