"In a serene hillside in the Lake District with rolling green meadows,the morning sun makes a peaceful atmosphere.The Tortoise falling from the sky towards a rocky ground, with the stick slipping from his teeth. The Ducks and the Crow are above, looking down in shock. The Tortoise is medium-sized, with a green, bumpy shell, and a determined look. Duck 1 and Duck 2 are small-sized, with white feathers, orange beaks, and friendly expressions. The Crow is small-sized, with black feathers, a sharp beak, and curious eyes."
