"In a serene hillside in the Lake District with rolling green meadows,the morning sun makes a peaceful atmosphere.The Tortoise sitting on a rock, looking sad while talking to two Ducks standing by the pond. The Tortoise is medium-sized, with a green, bumpy shell, and determined eyes. Duck 1 and Duck 2 are small-sized, with white feathers, orange beaks, and friendly expressions."
