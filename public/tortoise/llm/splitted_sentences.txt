0. One day he met a pair of Ducks and told them all his trouble.
1. "We can help you to see the world,"
2. said the Ducks.
3. "Take hold of this stick with your teeth and we will carry you far up in the air where you can see the whole countryside. But keep quiet or you will be sorry."
4. The Tortoise was very glad indeed.
5. He seized the stick firmly with his teeth, the two Ducks took hold of it one at each end, and away they sailed up toward the clouds.
6. Just then a Crow few by.
7. He was very much astonished at the strange sight and cried,
8. "This must surely be the King of Tortoises!"
9. "Why certainly——"
10. began the Tortoise.
11. But as he opened his mouth to say these
12. foolish words he lost his hold on the stick,
13. and down he fell to the ground, where he was dashed to pieces on a rock.
